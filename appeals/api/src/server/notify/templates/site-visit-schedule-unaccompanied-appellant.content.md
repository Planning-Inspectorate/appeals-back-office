You are not required to attend the site visit.

# About the visit

The purpose of the site visit is for the inspector to view the site and its surroundings. You are only required to give the inspector access to the site.

You cannot give the inspector any documents or discuss the appeal with them.

The inspector will carry out the inspection on their own.
