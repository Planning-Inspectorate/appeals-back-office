# Site visit scheduled

We have now arranged for our inspector (or their representative) to visit {{site_address}}.

You are not required to attend the site visit.

# About the visit

If you see the inspector, be aware that you cannot give them any documents or discuss the appeal with them.

The inspector will carry out the inspection on their own.

# Next steps

We will let you know our inspector’s decision when it is available.

If you need to contact us, include our reference number in any communication.
