# The site visit has changed

You are no longer required to provide access to our inspector (or their representative) for the site visit to {{site_address}} on {{visit_date}}.

The inspector will now carry out the inspection on their own.

# About the visit

If you see the inspector, you cannot give them any documents or discuss the appeal with them.

If you need to contact us, include our appeal reference number in any communication.
