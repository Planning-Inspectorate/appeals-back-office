# The site visit has changed

We now require you (or someone else) to attend the site visit to provide access for our inspector.

# Visit details

Our inspector (or their representative) will visit {{site_address}} between {{start_time}} and {{end_time}} on {{visit_date}}.

# Give the inspector access to the site

Someone must be at the site at the scheduled time to give the inspector access to the site.

If nobody is available, you can give written consent for the inspector to access the site by themselves. Explain how the inspector can safely access the site with your consent.

In all cases, email {{team_email_address}} to either give:

- the details of who will be at the site to give the inspector access
- your consent for the inspector to access the site by themselves

Include your appeal reference number in the subject of your email: {{appeal_reference_number}}.

# About the visit

You cannot give the inspector any documents or discuss the appeal with them.

For health and safety reasons, make sure any pets are safely secured during the site visit. 

The inspector will carry out the inspection on their own.
