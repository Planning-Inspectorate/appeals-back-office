# The site visit has changed

We now require you, or someone else, to attend the site visit to provide access for our inspector.

# Visit details

Our inspector (or their representative) will visit {{site_address}} between {{start_time}} and {{end_time}} on {{visit_date}}.

Alternatively, and only if it is possible at the site, you can provide written consent for access for our inspector at planningcaseofficerscbos@planninginspectorate.gov.uk. Include our appeal reference number in any communication.

# About the visit

You cannot give the inspector any documents or discuss the appeal with them.

The inspector will carry out the inspection on their own.
