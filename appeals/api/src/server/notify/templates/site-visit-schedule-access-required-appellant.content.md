The inspector (or their representative) will visit {{site_address}} between {{start_time}} and {{end_time}} on {{visit_date}}.

If nobody is available, you can give written consent for the inspector to access the site by themselves. Explain how the inspector can safely access the site with your consent.

In all cases, email {{team_email_address}} to either give:

# About the visit

The purpose of the site visit is for the inspector to view the site and its surroundings. You are only required to give the inspector access to the site.

You cannot give the inspector any documents or discuss the appeal with them.

The inspector will carry out the inspection on their own.
