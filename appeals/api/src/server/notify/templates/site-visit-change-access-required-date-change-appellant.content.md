# Giving the inspector access to the site

You, or someone else, must be at the site at the scheduled time to provide access for our inspector.

Alternatively, and only if it is possible at the site, you can provide written consent for access for our inspector at {{team_email_address}}.

Include our appeal reference number in any communication.

# About the visit

You cannot give the inspector any documents or discuss the appeal with them.

The inspector will carry out the inspection on their own.
